Convert the ER diagram to four relations as above.\\\\ 
We plan to create four tables in the database. The first one named Courses, includes six attributes--CID, TERM, SUBJ, CRSE, SEC, UNITS, and its key is {CID,TERM,SUMMER}. The second one named Students, includes eight attributes--SID, SURNAME, PREFNAME, LEVEL, CLASS, MAJOR, STATUS, EMAIL, and its key is SID. The third one named Take, and it stores information about which courses are chosen by which student. This table is got for many-many weak relationship Take, and it includes four attributes--CID, SID, UNITS, GRADE, SEAT. Its key is {CID, SID, TERM,SUMMER}. The last one named Meeting, which is a weak entity. It includes nine attributes--INSTRUCTORS, TYPE, DAYS, TIME, BUILD, ROOM, CID, SUMMER, TERM, and its key is {TYPE, DAYS, TIME, CID, SUMMER, TERM}.
